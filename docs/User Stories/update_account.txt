As a logged in user, I want to update my account information (email, linked Google account, password, etc.) in order to keep my account secure or better reflect my currently used login information. As a logged in user, you can access the Account Information page by pressing the Account Information button in your user portal. You will be directed to a page where you can change account fields such as your email or your password by typing a new one in a text box underneath your current account info. You can confirm the changes by pressing the Confirm button at the bottom of the page.

If there's an error during this process, try filling out the fields again as there may be invalid characters used in them or errors such as "invalid email" appearing. Then try confirming the changes once more. Again, if it is a reoccurring error, you can contact support via email in order for them to assist you.
