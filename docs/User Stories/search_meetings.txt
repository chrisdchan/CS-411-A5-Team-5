As a logged-in user, I want to search for specific meetings by typing in keywords into a search bar located on my home page such as the meeting’s date or using words/phrases that came up during the meeting, so that I can then access that meeting’s summary and details. If no meetings show up as a result of the search, then no saved meetings exist for the user or no meetings matching the search terms currently exist.
