As a logged-in user, if you are looking for a meeting summary, you can navigate to the Meetings button in your user portal. If you need to get a summary for a new meeting, simply click the New Meeting button and upload the audio recording of your meeting. As the meeting transcript and summary load, you can see their progress in the dashboard. Once the meeting is loaded, click on it in the table that says Meetings. All of this is under the Meeting tab in the dashboard. Once you click on a meeting, you will be able to see and export the transcript and summary.

During this process, if an error is encountered, simply navigate back to the Meetings tab and re-upload the meeting. If you are still encountering issues, you may send a support request email to the support email in the footer of each page, and our team will assist you.
